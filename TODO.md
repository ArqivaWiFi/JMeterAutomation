Further things to test:

* When trying to access the captive portal from a non-captive network, you get
  the response "Your Internet connection is unlimited."
* Accessing things over HTTPS should fail when not logged in.
* What should happen over HTTPS when logged in?
* After X minutes, you should be logged out again. Test this!
